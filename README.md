# Heap_Data_Structures

Repository which includes implementation of Adaptable Priority Queue into Binary Heap
and Fibonacci Heap.

All insertions are made by reference, and so any changes to the Entry outside can destroy the\
Heap. Once inserted, the Entries keys and values must be changed with methods provided.

Some changes are still needed, such as more comments and exception handling.

Fibonacci Heap to be included soon.
