# Heap_Data_Structures

Repository which include implementation of Adaptable Priority Queue intp Binary Heap
and Fibonacci Heap.

All insertions are made by reference, and so any changes to the Entry outside can destroy the\
Heap. Once inserted, the Entries keys and values must be changed with methods provided.

Some changes are still needed, such as more comments, exception handling and a way
to rebuild the Heap if an error happens.

Fibonacci Heap to be included soon.
